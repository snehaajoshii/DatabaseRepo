# DatabaseRepo

The goal is to keep record of the customers and the books they have ordered from MindBooks. As a result, this small business can keep track of frequent customers, bestselling, and many more. Customers will have better access to books, record of their order history and the billing costs. To create a strong database, employees needed is one technician, one librarian and one customer service. To determine books to be delivered for each customer of MindBooks, we use the order table to record the purchases. Then with the orders, we are going to have the items in the order and their quantities. The books table will provide the database the list of books that was ordered in the order items. Another entities will be to keep a record of the author of the books and information about the author. Therefore, keeping track of author that sell out the most so that we can determine what more books can we add to our store!
